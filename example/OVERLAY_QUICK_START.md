# Quick Start Guide: Screen Overlay

## What is the Screen Overlay?

The Screen Overlay is a floating widget that appears on top of all your apps, showing:
- Your current activity
- Number of connected devices
- Connected users and their activities

Think of it like a "picture-in-picture" for your connection status!

## How to Enable

1. Open the Nearby Connections example app
2. Scroll down to find the **"Enable Screen Overlay"** button
3. Tap the button
4. If this is your first time:
   - Android will ask for permission to "Display over other apps"
   - Tap "Allow" or toggle the permission on
   - Go back to the app
   - Tap **"Enable Screen Overlay"** again
5. The overlay should now appear on your screen! 🎉

## How to Use

### Moving the Overlay
- **Touch and hold** anywhere on the overlay
- **Drag** it to your preferred location
- **Release** to place it there

### Reading the Overlay
```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│ 🔵 Your Name            │  ← That's you!
│    Your Activity        │  ← What you're doing
│    ● 2 connected        │  ← How many people are connected
│ ┌─────────────────────┐ │
│ │ • Friend            │ │  ← First connected user
│ │   Their Activity    │ │  ← What they're doing
│ └─────────────────────┘ │
└─────────────────────────┘
```

### Icons Meaning
- 🕐 = Idle (not doing much)

## How to Disable

1. Open the app
2. Tap **"Disable Screen Overlay"**
3. The overlay will disappear

You can re-enable it anytime!

## Tips & Tricks

- **In the way?** Just drag it to a corner or edge of your screen
- **Want it always on?** Keep the overlay enabled and switch between apps freely
